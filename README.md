## Description

If you've ever needed a secure password that fits your specific specifications, then you've come to the right place! You can choose the length of your password (between 8 and 128 characters, of course), and if you would like to have uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters within your password. The password will be randomly generated and copied directly to your clipboard for ease of use to allow you to paste it into your desired login page. It also displays on the webpage if you need to copy it again in the future. Password security is very important these days, so make sure to generate your new password today! 

This application is written in JavaScript with HTML and CSS.

## 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

### Your Task

This week’s homework requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of password special characters](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters) from the OWASP Foundation.

### User Story
