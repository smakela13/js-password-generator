## Description

If you've ever needed a secure password that fits your specific specifications, then you've come to the right place! You can choose the length of your password (between 8 and 128 characters, of course), and if you would like to have uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters within your password. The password will be randomly generated and copied directly to your clipboard for ease of use to allow you to paste it into your desired login page. It also displays on the webpage if you need to copy it again in the future. 

Password security is very important these days, so make sure to generate your new password today! 

This application is written in JavaScript with HTML and CSS.
